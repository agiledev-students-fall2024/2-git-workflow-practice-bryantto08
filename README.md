## Article Thoughts

- I chose this article because discusses the importance of the Agile Methodology, which is a focal point of
  this class, as well as structure of the Agile lifecycle and the different models in which Agile is implemented.
  For example, we discussed about Scrum in class as a type of Agile framework, but there are others such as Kanban, a similar framework used for shorter cycles of feature delivery, or Extreme Programming, a framework more designed for constantly changing requirements. I find it interesting how there are so many different implementations of Agile, all of which offer unique and different ways to manage the workflow of a project efficiently, based on the needs of the development team.
