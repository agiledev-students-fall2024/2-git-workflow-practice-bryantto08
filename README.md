## Article Thoughts
* I chose this article because discusses the importance of the Agile Methodology, which is a focal point of
this class, as well as structure of the Agile lifecycle and the different models in which Agile is implemented.
For example, we discussed about Scrum in class as a type of Agile framework, but there are others such as Kanban, a similar framework used for shorter cycles of feature delivery, or Extreme Programming, a framework more designed for constantly changing requirements. I find it interesting how there are so many different implementations of Agile, all of which offer unique and different ways to manage the workflow of a project efficiently, based on the needs of the development team.

## Gilad Spitzer's thoughts
* The article highlights the versatility and adaptability of Agile methodology, emphasizing its significance in project management and development workflows. Agile's strength lies in its flexible frameworks, like Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming, each catering to different team needs and project requirements. Your observation about the variety within Agile is insightful, as it illustrates how different frameworks provide tailored approaches for managing workflows. Scrum, with its structured sprints and roles, is effective for teams requiring regular feedback and iteration, while Kanban suits those looking for a continuous, visual flow of tasks. Meanwhile, Extreme Programming focuses on rapidly evolving projects with frequent changes in requirements. This diversity within Agile allows teams to select a framework that best aligns with their goals, team dynamics, and project complexities, ultimately promoting efficiency and adaptability in delivering high-quality products.

Agile focuses on value-driven outcomes and responsive changes through its core values and principles laid out in the Agile Manifesto. These include prioritizing individuals over processes, working software over documentation, customer collaboration, and adaptability to change. In today's fast-evolving technological and market landscapes, organizations need development processes that can keep up with rapid changes!

* From Claire: I found this article super interesting because it gives a good overview of the values and benefits of Agile. Additionally, I liked reading about the different examples of Agile, like XP and FDD, because they're frameworks that I'm not familiar with yet. After reading, I'm interested to learn more about the history of Agile and how it came to be. What led developers to adopt Agile, and how will it evolve in the future?
